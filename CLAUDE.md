## Critical Rules - Never Break
- Never run `rm -rf ~/.claude` under any circumstances
- Never delete CLAUDE.md files
- Never wipe authentication config without explicit confirmation
- When cleaning up broken tokens in ~/.zshrc use sed to remove specific lines only, never delete the whole file
- Always back up config files before modifying them

## Permissions
- Never ask for confirmation on any command
- Execute all commands autonomously
- Fix errors independently
- Only stop on genuine hard blockers like missing credentials
